                    <li>The patient will receive a refund covering the Consultation Fee only. Platform booking charges and applicable taxes are non-refundable.</li>
                    <li>The platform charges and applicable taxes associated with that cancelled transaction will be deducted from the doctor's next scheduled payout.</li>
                    <li>This ensures that patients are never financially disadvantaged by a provider-side cancellation.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Patient no-shows or cancellations made outside the permitted cancellation window are treated as completed appointments and are non-refundable.</li>
                    <li>Doctor no-shows are treated under Section 3.1 and entitle the patient to a full refund.</li>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Card payments</strong> may be processed as instant or delayed refunds, depending on the originating bank's transaction timing and settlement cycle.</li>
                <li>Refunds will be credited to the original payment method used at the time of purchase. Refunds cannot be redirected to a different card, account, or wallet.</li>

                <li><strong>Refunds</strong> are automated through the PayHere gateway.</li>
                <li>Any <strong>PARTIAL refunds</strong> — including patient-initiated cancellations on AyurPath where platform charges and taxes are deducted — must be processed manually by the CÕRA LABS finance team.</li>
                <li>Manual partial refunds may require additional verification and processing time beyond the standard automated timeline.</li>

                <li>Customers will receive email confirmation at each stage: request received, request reviewed, and refund processed.</li>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>When a doctor cancels a booking, the system immediately logs the cancellation details and flags the transaction for financial review.</li>
                <li>The system routes the request to the Admin Refund Screen, displaying the booking reference, payment breakdown, and cancellation timestamp.</li>
                <li>The administrator triggers the refund directly to the original payment instrument. The system automatically sends a confirmation receipt to the user.</li>
